## Configuration

### Password Protection

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Anyone who knows your IP and port can join your server if no password is set!
### Option 1: In-Game Server Management
1. Start your server (ensure no `DSSettings.txt` file exists).
2. Open the StarRupture game client.
3. From the main menu, open **Manage Server** and connect to your server.
4. When prompted, configure an **Admin Password**.
5. Click **Change Password** and enter the join password for players.
6. Press **Back** (or ESC). **Do not** create or load a game at this point.
7. Stop your server.
8. Continue with the `DSSettings.txt` configuration below.


### Option 2: Manual way
1. Visit https://starrupture-utilities.com/passwords
2. Generate both an Admin password and a Player Password
3. Create `Password.json` in root of the container (`/home/container/`) and paste the contents of the site's password.json field into it

## Save Game Management

There are two ways to manage save games:

### Option 1: In-Game Server Management

1. From the main menu, click **Manage Server**.
2. Enter your server IP and port to connect.
3. From here, you can create a new world or load an existing save.

### Option 2: Manual Configuration (Loading save when server starts.)

Create a `DSSettings.txt` file in the root directory (`/home/container/`) with the following content:

```json
{
  "SessionName": "MySaveGame",
  "SaveGameInterval": "300",
  "StartNewGame": "false",
  "LoadSavedGame": "true",
  "SaveGameName": "AutoSave0.sav"
}
```
